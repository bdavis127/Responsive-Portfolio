      <p>Hello, and welcome to my bio page. Concerning my working background, I have over twenty years of experience in the fields of Software Training and Instructional Design.  
          I have worked in the sectors of Healthcare, Department of Defense, and Education.
      </p>

      <p>I lived in Germany for about five years, and while I lived there I learned to speak German, traveled Europe, and worked for the U.S. Army.  While working for the U.S. Army
          Research Medical Unit as a Research Assistant, I assisted in compiling data that measured soldier morale.
